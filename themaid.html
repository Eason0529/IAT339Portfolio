      <h1>Project Overview:</h1>
      <p>The Maid is a web based interactive game. Player will explore the story from the perspective of "Doris". 
          During the process of the game, player can interact with the elements appear on the screen and try to collect 
          information and clue to progress the story forward. The player starts the protagonist Doris a new day by clicking the “Start” button. Meanwhile, the player's mission
          is to help Doris figure out what is happening behind the peaceful daily life then try to save herself.
          Our game has three suspects totally, and the player as Doris need to investigate the house through and collect the 
          information as much as they can to find out the bad guy. 
      </p>

      


         <p>Before the player chooses any suspects, the game will gradually explain each character and their relationship with
          the protagonist by investigating the clues in the room. For example, when the player enters Denny’s room, they 
          could open Denny’s diary on the table to understand Denny recently fall in love in school. When they come to Marcus’s
           laboratory, the player can discover Marcus’s research paper to realize he is now studying on the clone.</p>

           <p>After gathering these clues, the game will keep moving on, and the player will help Doris to decide how she needs 
           to react for the next step. Player’s decision will determine the story’s ending differently and affect Doris’s destiny.
            This game has two ends. If the player, choose the correct suspect she will protect herself correctly and keeps herself
             alive. However, in other words, wrong suspect selection will cause her death.</p>

              As a maid, she(the player) can find out the ending based on her understanding by discovering a series of clues throughout the 
              manor: Marcus is a scientist whose researching the cloning technology. Marcus found that Daniel is not the son of him, so he
               used Daniel as his experimental object. After murdered the real Daniel, the cloned “Daniel” has already replaced the real 
               Daniel. After Donna Marina found out this, to revenge for her own son, she cloned Marcus through the machine and then made 
               the real Marcus into a sculpture. Marina was afraid of the truth being exposed as the maid(the player) has started to investigate,
                so she decided to clone Doris and then kill her. 
          </p>
          <p>
                This is a game that requires players to prevent themselves from being killed while solving crimes. If the player(Doris)
                 can inference all the cases, then he/she can avoid being murdered. If not, the player (Doris) would be  killed by Marina at the end.

                In order to allow us to feel the progress of the game more intuitively and clearly, we created a table to hold the appearance of all pages. With this table, the options and branches of the game are clear.
                For the concept art we made two scenes to show the preview of the game. The first is the place our story happened--Palmer Manor, the maid  and Hoffman family lives here. The second is Marcus's laboratory with the clone machines.
                For the storyboards, we got a hierarchy chart to show the flow of the game and three storyboards showing details about what's
                 going on and what the player would see in each scene, also including the stuffs can be investigated and how different choices 
                 would effect and lead the game to different endings.

                  At the same time, because the task requirements do not allow us to use too much material on the 
                  Internet, we spend a lot of time collecting materials from the Internet and post-processing these
                   pictures through such as illustrator, Photoshop and even Maya. For example, for the pictures I listed here,
                    we download free models of Maya and post-render them. After that, we found landscape pictures that fit our 
                    game style. Finally, we put them together by software. All the pictures you can see on the webpage are 
                    finished by our group one by one.
